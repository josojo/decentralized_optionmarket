You will need a working node.js setup ([instructions](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager)) and globally installed `grunt-cli` ([instructions](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started)).

Install truffle, testrpc, npm install -g ether-pudding, npm install -g bluebird, npm install -g web3, npm install -g promise, npm install -g path, npm install -g fs 

start testrpc,
truffle deploy
